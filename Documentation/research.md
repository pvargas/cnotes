# Research

Most of the research that was done for this project revolved around the text summarization. 

I initially decided on using Azure's Summarization Service, but after development began, I ended up going with OpenAI's offerings. 

A lot of time was spent reading how to properly use their API to summarize text. There was also some trail and error before things were working smoothly.

I also had to do some research when it came to deploying a Svelte application, since that was not something that I had done before.
